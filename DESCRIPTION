Title: Machine Learning-Based Mutational Signature Inference for WES and MSK-IMPACT data
Version: 0.9.23
Author: Jun Woo
Maintainer: Jun Woo <wooh@mskcc.org>
Depends: R (>= 3.6.0)
Imports: gtools, Rcpp (>= 0.12.16), utils, argparse, coneproj, data.table, RcppEigen, reticulate, RColorBrewer
Description: Infers mutation signature exposures from mutation catalog data using
    cancer-specific and pan-cancer reference signature lists via deep learning-trained models. 
    Also includes de novo extraction routines. Suitable for analysis of catalogs derived from
    limited mutation count data such as whole exome sequencing or MSK-IMPACT.
